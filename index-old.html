We currently have no clues as to when the new season will be released, but a June or July release can be expected. With Disney releasing&nbsp;<em>Cars 3</em>&nbsp;the day after school gets out for most students, and with the show having ended at the start of Summer Vacation, Disney may be planning a release date as early as June 19. However, the community will have to wait and see.<br /><br />The community is acting as normal for it being hiatus with regular iFunny posts in terms of content and quantity and relatively little activity on the Fandom. The STARCON Warning System does not expect there to be much more activity until the end of the hiatus. Despite the leak of a part of the new intro, the community isn't acting up or posting abnormally. In fact, almost nothing on the iFunny has even mentioned the leak in the first place, primarily because many people want to be surprised when the new season comes out and they see a remade intro.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

However, the situation may rapidly change and requires further monitoring after recent threats.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">The hiatus continues as the Fandom waits for an official announcement from Disney XD for the release date of Season 3. Currently the situation among the Fandom is similar to that found during the mid-Season-2 hiatus. However, at one point in time, there was 18,000 new iFunny posts under the #svtfoe tag over the course of six days. This is about 800% more active than the iFunny tag has ever been before. The STARCON Warning System believes that one person or a group of people decided to spam as much as possible one of the days, causing the tremendous increase in posts on iFunny. So far no threats have arisen from the iFunny.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">There has been some Tumblr activity involving harassment&nbsp;against Starco blogs. The STARCON Warning System does not have the intelligence to find these posts yet, but a couple have been spotted, causing a need to prevent a drop in the warning level. The issue seems to have died down in the past week, but further monitoring is required.<br /><br />Many people are still upset or worried about the events of the Season 2 Finale, but most people are just waiting for the next season to find out what happens. The majority of the Fandom has been comforted by the fact that Marco has the dimensional scissors, and many ship supporters are coming up with arguments that [unsuccessfully] try to prove their ship will remain/become canon while the other ships will never happen or end. However, this activity has also died down as we progress farther into the hiatus with most people impatiently waiting for a Tweet from Disney XD announcing the release of Season 3.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

However, the situation may rapidly change and requires further monitoring.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">The finale is over, plunging the show into yet another hiatus. Season 3 is still a bit away; however, as they've been working on it for 11 months now, Daron Nefcy said it wouldn't be long before Season 3 picks up. Disney XD did however tell us as much as the new season will kick off this summer. Additionally, Disney XD renewed</font><font size="5">&nbsp;<em>SVTFOE</em>&nbsp;</font><font size="5">for a fourth season prior to the Season 3 premiere, just like what they did with renewing for Season 3. According to Disney XD, Season 4 will premiere in 2018.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">The Season 2 Finale has flipped the tables on the Fandom and could possibly cause a bit of chaos. The Fandom is currently all sad about Star's leaving Earth; however, Marco still has the dimensional scissors, and even if he doesn't and Star has them, Star will probably find a way to sneak out of Mewni to meet up with Marco again.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">Toffee is now known to be the most powerful character in the show after managing to defeat the whole Magical High Commission. There is no doubt that he still knows that Star's biggest weakness is Marco. Knowing this, there is a huge chance that Toffee will once again put Marco in danger to drag Star in and quite possibly Queen Moon if she finds out. Being that Toffee is so powerful, it is questionable on whether or not the battle of Star and Queen Moon vs. Toffee will be victorious or a major defeat for Star and Queen Moon.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">After Star's confession to Marco that she has a crush on him, it is unclear on what will happen in Season 3 or how Marco is reacting to this on top of Star's departure from Earth. They will without a doubt meet up again (dimensional scissors), but we don't know how they will interact with each other when that time comes. We also can't predict what will happen to Marco's and Jackie's relationship after Star's confession, and with Marco's running to Star when she's leaving, the relationship between Marco and Jackie may be seriously damaged. However, this does not mean Starco will become canon; with the way Star and Marco were acting throughout the episode with that thought in mind, their relationship may actually be slightly damaged momentarily before mending together again, quite possibly as friends. We'll have to see how it plays through in Season 3.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">Today's two live chats with Marco and StarFan13 told us almost nothing about what they think of what just happened in the show, what they're going to do about it, or any hints on when Season 3 will be released. We were hoping to get a little bit out of it, but we've watched both of them throughout the whole thing and got little to nothing. "Marco" just claimed he was still taking everything in whenever somebody said something about contacting Star or how he feels about today's events, making trying to get anything about today's finale or Season 3 pointless. However, it was still an interesting chat to end the season off with, and the next day Disney XD announced that Season 3 will be released this summer and renewed the show for a fourth season, so the live chat seemed to be trying to make the news more of a surprise.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

STARCON 3.<br /><br />There is currently one minor imminent threat against the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and developers at this time that has lead to an emergency update. Details are minor as they are only focused on what caused the update. For more information, see the previous update.<br /><br />Recently, a group of people on iFunny have gathered together to start a small war against all Jarco people starting at approximately 1:30 am EST. Under normal circumstances this would not be much of an issue; however, they are planning on finding as many Jarco-supporting accounts as possible and spamming "Star doesn't look like a goblin", which originates from Jackie's highly-pierced ears from "Just Friends". Some may find this insulting while others see it as an attack on the show's developers. However they view it, it is small, growing threat that we found necessary to warn the community about and raise the alert level. We will continue to monitor the situation and update as soon as we can. Hopefully the threat will be gone by the end of the day and after the Season 2 Finale.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

Alert status for 8 P.M. EST, Tuesday, February 21, 2017. Condition code is Blue. STARCON 4.<br /><br />There are currently no major imminent threats against the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community or developers at this time. However, the situation may rapidly change and requires further monitoring.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">The promos for the&nbsp;<em>SVTFOE</em>&nbsp;Season 2 Finale have caused the Fandom to be kept on their toes as the outcome of the episode is completely unpredictable. Oskar shows up again, but Star seems to not care. It also seems Star may reveal her feelings towards Marco (as shown by "'I have to tell you something...' 'We need to talk...'"). In that aspect, we can only predict that Marco's and Star's friendship may be slightly harmed temporarily. Also, we don't know how Marco's and Jackie's friendship will be affected if Star does reveal her feelings towards Marco.<br /><br />Additionally, the Magical High Commission storm into Ludo's cave to find Toffee now controlling Ludo's body. Moon, just like Glossaryck, recognized him in an instant as shown in the promo as if they had fought before. It is obvious that they will go into battle against each other, but the outcome is unknown. However, there are only a handful of possible outcomes: Toffee wins; Toffee escapes; the Magical High Commission wins; or the Magical High Commission escapes. Also, there is a chance that Star, being a "rebel princess", will jump into the battle as one of the sides are more victorious and could turn around the whole battle. However, we don't have enough evidence to prove that any of these are any more likely than the others until next week.<br /><br />The Fandom is acting up a bit, especially iFunny, after the promo for Thursday's "Just Friends". It seems that Star and Marco both love the band, and Star invited Jackie to join her and Marco so Jackie didn't feel left out of all of the fun. The iFunny is also acting up after somebody posted a video of what happens in the episode: Star and Marco were singing together to a song that said in it "Just Friends". As it is from a leaked video of the episode, it is official and could greatly affect the finale and/or provide some foreshadowing.<br /><br />Additionally, the lines are foreshadowing and reminder of the show. Here is a quick connection of all of the lines to the show:<br /><br />"It was no secret the way that we feel. A love that's so pure, a love that's so real." &nbsp;- "Sleepover"<br /><br />"You showed me your world, and it felt like a sign." &nbsp;- "Star Comes to Earth"<br /><br />"But you acted too slow, and you ran out of ti-i-ime." &nbsp;- "Bon Bon the Birthday Clown"<br /><br />"And now we'll be...Just Friends..." &nbsp;- Foreshadowing that Starco may not get together for a while, or at least that Star and Marco are "Just Friends" until then.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

STARCON 4.<br /><br />There are currently no major imminent threats against the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community or developers at this time. However, recent events have lead to the need for still higher alertness.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">The&nbsp;<em>SVTFOE</em>&nbsp;Fandom is active again after the birth of a new ship from "Running With Scissors", Markapoo. However, the #svtfoe iFunny tag has become even crazier with the marathon going on all month and with the new ship. Many images seen in the Season 2 Part II trailer are now more clearly understood as episodes are released with those scenes. People have stopped interpreting the images knowing the episodes are soon to be released.<br /><br />With one week down and two to go, the status of the community is still unpredictable. One plot twist could affect the whole story line or remain in just that one episode like "Running With Scissors". Also, some recent episodes seem to be more like fillers rather than story episodes, but some episodes in Week 3 could get a lot of attention being that they go back to some story episodes, and the episode descriptions show that some game-changing events may occur. We will continue to monitor this situation as time goes by.<br /><br />With current events, it seems Starco will not become canon until the Season 3 mid-season finale or later with Jarco's existence until then. It seems "Just Friends" may worsen the Jarco relationship with Jackie possibly feeling like a third wheel (which Star is trying to prevent), but it should not completely break it apart and should eventually mend back together.<br /><br />With Glossaryck no longer on the same team as Star, it can be predicted that he will teach the spell book to Ludo as previously predicted. This will obviously give Ludo tremendous power, but, as seen from "Baby", Star is one of the most powerful future queens of Mewni since the queen of darkness herself, Eclipsa. With both Star and Ludo gaining power, it is unpredictable what will happen come later episodes, but it can be predicted that it will be a fairly balanced fight.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

STARCON 3.<br /><br />There are currently no major imminent threats against the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil&nbsp;</em>community or developers at this time. However, recent events with some minor threats/dangers have lead to the need to raise the level of alertness.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">The&nbsp;<em>SVTFOE</em>&nbsp;Fandom is now calmed down completely with little to no activity. However, the #svtfoe iFunny tag has become very crazy and was partially out of control for a bit. After Disney XD released the trailer for part two of Season 2 of&nbsp;<em>SVTFOE</em>, some images seen in the last 5 seconds were spotted by many viewers, some of which have been misinterpreted completely.&nbsp;One image shows Star and Marco close together with their lips in an O shape at a concert. Many Starco fans misinterpreted this to be a potential kiss, but as we see it is from "Just Friends" with the description of the episode being that Star and Marco invite Jackie to a concert with Star trying to make Jackie not feel like a third wheel, they are likely just singing. Marco is also seen with his right hand holding somebody else's, presumably Jackie's.<br /><br />Additionally, many people are trying to reinterpret the episode names after the release of the trailer as many previously interpreted ideas are now proven completely wrong. Unfortunately, many have interpreted the episodes now with a slight bias towards Starco, but at least now nobody's worrying too much about "Collateral Damage" (it's just an episode where Star tries to encourage the school after the Possum statue fell down). However, after Daron Nefcy's post of their making the final episode with a sad Star in the photo, "Starcrushed" is still a major area of focus with the complete outline of the episode still a partial mystery.<br /><br />With current events, it seems Starco will not become canon until the Season 3 mid-season finale or later with Jarco's existence until then. It seems "Just Friends" may worsen the Jarco relationship with Jackie possibly feeling like a third wheel (which Star is trying to prevent), but it should not completely break it apart and should eventually mend back together.<br /><br />As seen in the trailer and episode descriptions, Ludo will manage to keep the spell book away from Star and force Glossaryck to teach him about the spell book, giving Ludo tremendous power. Ludo will also become controlled by the Dark Magic like Marco was at the end of "Page Turner", except Ludo will not return to normal until he loses the wand. This will make the show more interesting in that Ludo is now an actual threat and not a joke as he seems to have been in episodes prior to "Bon Bon the Birthday Clown".</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

Everybody has started looking to the future and being more optimistic before commenting or posting, allowing us to lessen the STARCON level to 5 for the first time in nearly a month.<br /><br />Recently, Daron Nefcy, the creator of the show, has been quoted, saying there will actually be 22 episodes of Season 2, not just 14. Therefore, most predictions of Season 3 previously now apply to Season 2 as it is not yet over. Everybody mistook the definition of "mid-season", which actually meant the middle of the show's season. It is now unclear whether or not Starco will happen by the end of Season 2, but there is a chance it will happen by the time a mid-season finale of Season 3 comes about (if it's anything like this season). Otherwise, most predictions for the rest of the season remain, while the&nbsp;<em>SVTFOE</em>&nbsp;community is becoming even more impatient upon learning that the season isn't actually over, making it seem like it's been a long time since the season has been continued.</font></strong><br /><br /><strong><font size="5">The STARCON Warning System is a nonprofit group that measures the current status of the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community and episode/season status.

It is expected that Season 3 will be filled with more character development than either of the other two seasons had to offer due to the creation of Mackie/Jarco. Additionally, a rise in episodes involving interdimensional travel and trying to get Ludo is predicted; the "Normal Life" style episodes (such as "Girls' Day Out") will still occur, but most of those episodes will involve Marco and Jackie dating as compared to the previous Star and Marco spending time together in the Earth dimension.

STARCON 3.<br /><br />There are currently no imminent threats against the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;community at this time. However, recent actions and events have caused the need to raise the level of alertness. Additionally, new information has been discovered to cause the need for a repost of the alert status of the community.</font><br /><br /><font size="5">Ever since the release of Season 2 Episode 14 "Bon Bon the Birthday Clown", marking the last episode of the season, iFunny tag #svtfoe and the&nbsp;<em>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</em>&nbsp;Fandom have exploded. The main cause is currently known to be the disproving of Starco's creation in Season 2 and the official creation of Mackie (Marco and Jackie). The Starco page of the Fandom has recently been updated, saying probability of canon is now 99%, which is higher than the normal 98% and the previous 95%. This has caused iFunny to be slightly less active, but more and more people are still becoming mad at Marco despite everything that happened in the episode being Star's fault. More information on this can be found in the Message Board tab.<br /><br />It is unclear when the next season of the show will be released. This last episode left viewers at a huge cliffhanger in both the Starco world and the actual show's world after Star's spell book was taken. There are a few rumors about it being released in January, but, even though they have been working on the new season for a while now, it is safe to assume that the next season will be released anywhere from December to March. Due to the creation of Mackie (or Jarco) and the loss of Star's spell book, it is completely unknown what will happen in Season 3 (besides Star and Marco trying to get the spell book back), and this, along with the Fandom explosion, has caused a need for the warning level to be raised. We are expecting to stay at STARCON 3 or drop to 4 in the next 2-3 weeks.

The main cause is currently known to be the disproving of Starco's creation in Season 2 and the official creation of Mackie (Marco and Jackie). Due to the Starco page of the Fandom saying Starco is 100% guaranteed canon&nbsp;after Star showed through actions that she had a crush on Marco, the Fandom community status could be much worse.

This last episode left viewers at a huge cliffhanger in both the Starco world and the actual show's world after Star's spell book was taken. There are a few rumors about it being released in January, but due to the long time period it takes to make a season (approximately 2-3 years), mid-spring of 2017 is a more reasonable prediction.
